+ "The Telephony Logging Profile generates files that allow Apple to troubleshoot issues with your device and help Apple to improve its products and services. The generated files may contain some of your personal information, including contents of SMS's, device identifiers and names, the IP addresses and recent location history of your device, phone numbers of the registering device, Apple Accounts into which you are signed, and logs of incoming and outgoing calls and audio routes during the time the logging is enabled. If you install this profile, it will automatically turn the logging on and this data will be captured when you take a Sysdiagnose on this device. The data will not leave the device unless you initiate a Sysdiagnose and send the results. The profile will expire after 21 days. You will be able to turn on and off logging at any time while the Profile is installed. To turn off logging on your device, go to your iphone and watch app. By enabling this diagnostic tool and sending a copy of the generated files to Apple, you are consenting to Apple's use of the content of such files in accordance with its privacy policy (http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy)."
